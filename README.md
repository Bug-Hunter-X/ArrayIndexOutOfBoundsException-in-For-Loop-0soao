# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java
This example demonstrates a common error in Java programming: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. This exception occurs when you try to access an array element using an index that is out of bounds.  The index must be between 0 (inclusive) and the length of the array (exclusive). 

The `bug.java` file contains code with the error, while `bugSolution.java` shows the corrected version.  Understanding this error is crucial for writing robust and error-free Java applications.
